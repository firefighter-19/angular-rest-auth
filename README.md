# Project

This project shows the list of products using [Dummy API](https://dummyjson.com/) and includes basic auth.

Firstly, you need to get auth using 'username' and 'password' which is shown on the first (login) page. Then its automatically redirects you to the page with products.

You are able to filter products by category, use pagination, make sort.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

The coverage of tests is pretty low, we test only services (its request to [Dummy API](https://dummyjson.com/)
)

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
